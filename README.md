# Noise's Hardoween
- A  decompilation of the Pizza Tower Halloween demo from 2019.
- I am not associated with PTG, or Sertif.

# Requirements
- [GameMaker 2024.8.1.171](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.8.1.171.exe)<br/>

# Featuring
- No more asset indexes (scr_soundeffect(83), sprite_index = choose(820, 829, ...), etc.)
- FIxed tilesets (no more utmt jumbled tilesets)
- Fixed State names (state = 0 is now state = states.normal)

# Notes
- This is still a **Work in progress**, allthough working without gamebreaking issues.
- Some code still needs tyding up, and feel free to make a pull request.
